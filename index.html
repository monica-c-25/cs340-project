<p>With countless LEGO kits to choose from, many of which have limited production, LEGO FOMO aims to alleviate the fear of missing out by providing users with the latest information of LEGO sets. Each year, LEGO releases approximately 1008 new sets with the typical availability ranging from 1-3 years before being retired. LEGO FOMO provides a database that contains various sets made by LEGO. Information such as customer demographics, price, release date, and collection are captured to assist a potential buyer in determining which product to purchase. LEGO FOMO has Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for users to add or update product information.</p>
